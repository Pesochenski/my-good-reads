# eBay React Coding Exercise Repo

## Additionally

I use node version `15.14.0`, so node-sass and sass-loader in default project are old and not supported by my node. To be more correct: node-sass version `4.14.1` and sass-loader version `8.0.2`. That's why I was need to use these commands for further successful code writing: 
    
    yarn eject
    yarn remove node-sass && yarn add node-sass@5.0.0
    yarn remove sass-loader && yarn add sass-loader@10.1.1
